      • Facial recognition<br>
      <img src="p6.jpg" alt="100%">
      Facial recognition technology is used to match photos of people’s faces to their identities. technology is
      integrated into major products that we use every day. <br> example, Face book is using computer vision to identify
      people in photos.
      Facial recognition is a crucial technology for biometric authentication. Many mobile devices available on the
      market today allow users to unlock devices by showing their faces. A front face camera is used for facial
      recognition; mobile devices process this image and, based on analysis, can tell whether the person who is holding
      a device is authorized on this device. The beauty of this technology is that it works really fast.<br><br>
      • Augmented reality<br>
      <img src="p2.jpg" alt="100%">
      Computer vision is a core element of augmented reality apps. This technology helps AR apps to detect physical
      objects (both surfaces and individual objects within a given physical space) in real-time and use this information
      to place virtual objects within the physical environment. The Ikeas Place app uses AR to help users understand
      whether the furniture they want to buy will fit into their interior.<br><br>
      • Self-driving cars<br>

      Computer vision enables cars to make sense of their surroundings. A smart vehicle has a few cameras that capture
      videos from different angles and send videos as an input signal to the computer vision software. The system
      processes the video in real-time and detects objects like road marking, objects near the car (such as pedestrians
      or other cars), traffic lights, etc. One of the most notable examples of applications of this technology is
      autopilot in Tesla cars.<br><br>
      • Health<br>
      <img src="p8.jpg" alt="100%">
      Image information is a key element for diagnosis in medicine because it accounts for 90 percent of all medical
      data. Many diagnoses in health are based on image processing—X-rays, MRI, and mammography, just to name a few. And
      image segmentation proved its effectiveness during medical scans analysis. For example, computer vision algorithms
      can detect diabetic retinopathy, the fastest-growing cause of blindness. Computer vision can process pictures of
      the back of the eye (see below) and rate them for disease presence and severity. Computer vision algorithms can be
      used to process retinal funds photographs to screen for diabetic retinopathy.
