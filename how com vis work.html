        Computer vision technology tends to manic the way the human brain work. One of the popular hypothesis states that
      our brains rely on creates computer vision system.<br>
        Computer vision algorithms that we use today are based on pattern recognition we train computer on a massive
      amount of visual data –computer process images, label object on them and find pattern in those objects. For
      example, if we send a million images of flowers, the computer will analyze them, identify pattern that are similar
      to all flower and at the end of this process, will create a model “flower”. As a result, the computer will be able
      to accurately detect whether a particular image is a flower every time we send them pictures.<br>
        Golan Levin, in his article image processing and computer vision, provides technical details about the process
      that machines follow in interpreting images. In short machines interpret images as a series of pixel, each with
      their own set color value.<br>
         Long story short, computer vision technology is one of the most sought-after tech concepts these days. Innovation
      is omnipresent in our lives .from driving cars to using sea implementing computer vision solution.<br>
                   • AR-enhanced image and videos<br>
                   • Robot in retail and supply chain<br>
                   • Advanced medical imaging tools<br>
                   • Tools to enhance co-ed images<br>
                   • Approaches TO mitigate biases in sports<br>
                   • Techniques to boost agriculture industry<br>
      A critical prerequisite to making the innovation a cross-industry trend is data growth worldwide. according to
      statistics, users share online more than 3 billion images daily i built cameras and personal mobile device
      generate data permanently.<br>
      The first step is feature engineering as a part of which the computer converts the image or a video in to an array
      of pixels and then identifies the features such as a blob corner and an edge of an object. It is a time –consuming
      and costly process. But with the help of deep learning the process of feature engineering can be automated.
      It is necessary to train the computer so that the CV system can be applied .as a part of training the machine a
      large number of images are fed to the system so that system can learn the difference between different object and
      differentiate them.<br>
      The images that are processed to the machine for training purpose vary according to the domain. As an example, in
      ophthalmology, the computer needs to diagnose the retina, including the healthy, damaged, and diseased.
      Once the machine analyzes the pixels, computer vision uses a neural network to predict the content of the image
      with each prediction, the computer is fed through the different layers of the neural network many times so that
      the machine come with a correct prediction with multiple processing, the machine come up with correct predictions
      in the form of probability .In this way, the artificial intelligence development company is working a lot in the
      field of computer vision.<br>
      Let’s take a simple example, when we meet a new person, as soon as we see that person, we brain activates through
      the neurons present in our body and in our mind we remembers the person’s face or we can say that face has been
      stored in our mind. Now as soon as that person tells his/her name, next time we see that person we will recognize
      them by their name. our neurons activate our brain to store remember that person face and assign a name to them
      like that guy in black shirt, so in our mind we have trained that face by its features or any other object
      pattern. That thing is called feature matching. Similarly, a deep learning architecture works in the similar way.
      As soon as the machine see the image of a person, we apply neurons to the input and the model extract the features
      of that person’s face by applying some operations and as soon as that features is extracted, we apply convolution
      neural network to make the model learn that face. Now we must be thinking about, how thing work inside the machine
      brain or Neural network. Machine reads the image in a matrix format. Like it reads image in a 3D matrix or say RGB
      format. The feature of the image is nothing but pixel values of the matrix. We convert that matrix into gray scale
      format or say 3D to1D to extract the features in short time, so training will be done in less amount of time. As
      soon as it done, machine sends the model into dense neural network and let it finish training the features for
      that face. And at last machine learns the features of that face and hence model trained.
      In the similar way, if we way to detect something like box, laptop or else, this is done in similar way.
      It’s all about the data in computer vision. If the data is not proper, there will be no accuracy. The proper the
      data, the better will be result.
      Simply it analyzes the data, extract it and learn.
