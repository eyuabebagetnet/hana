      Computer vision is a popular topic in articles about new technology.<br> A different approach to using data is what makes this technology different. Tremendous amounts of data that we create daily which some people think as a curse of our generation, are actually used for our benefit—the data can teach computers to see and understand objects. This technology also demonstrates an important step that our civilization makes toward creating artificial intelligence that will be as sophisticated as humans.
